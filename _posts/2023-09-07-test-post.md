This is a small test post.

This is to demonstrate how the blogging works with Jekyll.

If you notice, there are tags as well. We can use this to make portfolio posts.

We can also embed code

```c++
using namespace std;
cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
#=> prints `Hello, world!` to STDOUT.
```

We can also [embed links](https://generalred.itch.io/)
