          <p class="major">
            Tools Engineering was my first love in the game development world.
            My first foray into this was building tools to for my own projects.
            Once I got into larger projects with more diverse teams, I found I
            naturally fit as the force multiplier. I loved working working with
            my teammates to make their lives easier and designing tools that
            might bring out the best in them.

            I worked on a 6-person team where I served as the Tools and AI

          <h2>Impressive Impressionism</h2>
          <p>
            Impressive Impressionism was my Graphics final project with a 3
            person team. We created a robust, real-time, non-photorealistic
            shader pipeline in Unity that allows the user to develop painterly
            visuals to replicate the art style of impressionism. I worked on the
            shader pipeline that produced the paint-stroke-like visuals, which
            was involved combined the work of 4 different shaders that I
            developed. I compiled everyone's work into a single user-friendly
            pipeline.

          <h3>Involvement</h3>
          <p>
            I worked on a 3-person team. I built the paint-stroke shader and the
            full composite shader pipeline that parametrizes and composites all
            the shaders together.

          <h2>Unity Behavior Tree Tool</h2>
          <p>
            The Unity Behavior Tree Tool is a full behavior tree implementation
            built in Unity complete with a in-editor GUI built with Unity's UI
            Toolkit and GraphView. My main motivation to make this was to aid in
            the development of Sandborne as well. It was instrumental in us
            implementing two multi-staged boss fights in the tight three-month
            timeline that we were working with.
          </p>
          <h3>Involvement</h3>
          <p>
            This is a solo project. I designed the behavior tree system and the
            accompanying GUI myself.
