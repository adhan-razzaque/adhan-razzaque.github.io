          <h1>Sandborne</h1>
          <p class="major">
            Sandborne was my team senior capstone project for the 3D Game
            Development Capstone at UT Austin. I worked with a six person team
            where I served as the Tools and AI Programmer and Release Engineer.
            Sandborne allowed me to develop my skills in Unity, Graphics, AI,
            and Tools Development.
            <br />
            We completed Sandborne in one semester, roughly three months, and
            shipped to itch.io with Windows, MacOS, and Web builds. Below are
            parts of Sandborne that I worked on. You can also play for yourself!

                  The Unity Behavior Tree Tool is a full behavior tree
                  implementation built in Unity complete with a in-editor GUI
                  built with Unity's UI Toolkit and GraphView. My main
                  motivation to make this was to aid in the development of
                  Sandborne. It was instrumental in us implementing the two
                  multi-staged boss fights, Screwman and Batteryman in the tight
                  three-month timeline that we were working with.

                  One of the main highlights of Sandborne are the two
                  multi-stage boss fights, Screwman and Batteryman. I took the
                  lead on the implementation where I built the Boss Controllers,
                  Boss AI, and hooked together level scripting to trigger the
                  bosses. The boss fights were a massive feat for us to complete
                  across the board, in engineering, art, and design. They proved
                  to be a big attraction for players and received praise for
                  their complex and engaging mechanics.

                  Sandborne received lots of positive feedback around its
                  onboarding and tutorialization. The level scripting was
                  fundamental to that success. I worked on tutorial markers, the
                  journals system, and the checkpoints. We gradually developed
                  these features between playtests as we received more feedback
                  on how to better guide the player through the game. I saw
                  better feedback each time we iterated on these systems.

                <p>
                  One of our main concerns for Sandborne was making sure it was
                  accessible to both keyboard-mouse and controllers players. One
                  of the steps we took to accomplish this was building a dynamic
                  controls UI system to go hand in hand with our
                  tutorialization. This system dynamically switches the
                  controller glyphs based on the player's device.

                <p>
                  One of our main struggles through the development of Sandborne
                  was figuring out how to effectively communicate when the
                  player was taking damage. This was achieved through adding
                  various sound, diegetic, and visual cues. I worked on the
                  visual cues in the form of damage indicators and a health bar.
                  These indicators proved to be very helpful in communicating
                  damage to the player and we saw a significant improvement in
                  player reaction once they were implemented.

                </span>
                <p>
                  Another struggle we faced in Sandborne's development was the
                  player losing sight of the boss they were facing. We didn't
                  want to add a boss lock-on system because this would clash
                  with the claw mechanic we had in place. Instead, I opted for
                  boss indicators that show when the boss exits your field of
                  view. This allowed the player a general sense of where the
                  boss is without having to look directly at them.

                  Our artists were already tasked with a lot of work and we
                  wanted to build a more cartoony aesthetic on top of it all. I
                  offered to relieve them of some work off their hands and
                  practice my shader skills by building a toon shader for the
                  environmental elements. This was the first toon shader I ever
                  made in a Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. It's seen best
                  here.

                  The force field shader is almost a pet project that I got to
                  shoehorn into Sandborne. I wanted to experiment with shaders
                  more and I had the perfect opportunity when we needed to make
                  force fields. It took more load off our artists and allowed me
                  to experiment with shader graph and the Universal Render
                  Pipeline.

                  I was tasked with being the release engineer of Sandborne in
                  order to maintain our fever pace and ensure we had a
                  deliverable each week. We were expected to execute on 1-week
                  sprints and deliver builds for biweekly playtests. I
                  maintained this through a well designed release pipeline and
                  weekly content locks. This allowed us to stay accountable and
                  consistent to our goals. This process also allowed us to reach
                  our goal of shipping onto Web, Windows, and MacOS.

                  final boss of the game and one of the last things we finished.
                  Batteryman was the culmination of everything here and it
                  showed in the final product. Batteryman was designed at the
                  start, but the implementation had yet to come. We were able to
                  complete it in little over a week, from art to engineering to
                  final implementation. I built Batteryman's AI, boss
                  controller, level scripting around it, and its attacks. I even
                  made the shader for the laser seen here by iterating on the
                  force field shader.
